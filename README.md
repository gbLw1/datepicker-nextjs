# NEXT Datepicker

This project is a simple datepicker component that highlights an array of dates in a calendar.
The array used for the example is called `sessions` and is located in the [`src/data/sessions.ts`](src/data/sessions.ts) file.

The user can navigate through the months and years to select a date. 
The selected date is displayed below the calendar with all the information about the selected date such as the day of the week, the month, the year and yada yada yada.
